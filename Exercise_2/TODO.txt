Powerpoint slides:

* 1-3 slides about Regression Tree implementation (Complete)

* 1-3 slides describing Random Forest implementation (Complete)

* 1-3 slides performance metrics (define/describe them)
    - MSE (mean squared error)
    - R2 score (gives percentage of explained variance by the model)
    - training times
    - prediction times

* models compared (1-2 slides): (Complete)
    - RegressionTree (custom)
    - RandomForest (custom)
        * 3 configs: 
            (10 trees, depth 5) - faster to train, lower accuracy
            (50 trees, depth 10) - middle option
            (100 trees, depth 15) - longer training time, improved accuracy (on par with sklearn models)
    - DecisionTreeRegressor (sklearn)
    - RandomForestRegressor (sklearn)
    - GradientBoostingRegressor (sklearn)

* dataset descriptions: - (Complete)
    - 2-5 slides
    - see comparison_results_metadata.txt for description of datasets and of final columns in comparison_results.txt

* experiment process: (Complete)
    - 5-fold cross validation for each model
    - for each fold, training/prediction time was measured and recorded, plus accuracy metrics

* Creation of comparison charts

* comparison of models:
    - stacked bar charts (or box plots, to show std deviations?) for each dataset, show performance of each model separately
    - training/prediction times
    - MSE/R2 score
    - 7 models, so may be easiest to show one table per dataset, rather than plotting
    - But: at least 2 charts/tables per dataset, so 6 tables minimum (6 slides minimum)
    - Could also do instead one chart per model, showing all metrics at once
        * thus 7 slides

* Conclusions/lessons learned (2+ slides, could be many)
    - give conclusions about best model
    - performance (accuracy) vs training/prediction time tradeoffs (if any)
    - Good finding: parallelization of tree growth for random forests sped up training time SIGNIFICANTLY (6-10x improvement in training time)
        * unfortunately no recorded metrics to back this up, though
