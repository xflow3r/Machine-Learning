## Cleaning LaTeX Build Files
If you encounter compilation errors or want to remove excess files generated by LaTeX (such as `.aux`, `.log`, `.out`, `.toc`, etc.), you can use the provided Makefile:

```bash
make clean
```

This command will delete all auxiliary files and the generated PDF, to make a clean slate for the next compilation.
