This directory contains the LaTeX source for the report of Exercise 0 in the Machine Learning course.

## Cleaning LaTeX Build Files
If you encounter compilation errors or want to remove excess files generated by LaTeX (such as `.aux`, `.log`, `.out`, `.toc`, etc.), you can use the provided Makefile:

```bash
make clean
```

This command will delete all auxiliary files and the generated PDF, to make a clean slate for the next compilation.

## Road Safety Dataset Histograms

A Python script is provided to download the Road Safety dataset from OpenML and generate histograms for key attributes.

### Setup Instructions
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Run the Script
To generate and show the histograms, run:
```bash
python road_safety_histograms.py
```

This will download the dataset and display histograms for:
- Age_of_Driver
- Age_of_Casualty
- Sex_of_Driver
- Sex_of_Casualty
- Weather_Conditions
- Accident_Index (target)

Graphs use the colors #3498db and #e74c3c for visual distinction.
