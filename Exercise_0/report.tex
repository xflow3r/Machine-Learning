\section{Introduction and Dataset Selection}

In this report, we describe two datasets selected for our machine learning analysis: the \textbf{Road Safety Dataset} and the \textbf{Adult (Census Income) Dataset}. These datasets were chosen to satisfy the requirement of having different characteristics across multiple dimensions.


\section{Dataset 1: Road Safety}

The Road Safety (TODO: add hyperlink here with the OpenML dataset ID) dataset contains information about road accidents in the UK from 1979 to 2015. It was chosen for its rich feature set, including categorical and numerical data, and its relevancy for traffic safety analysis.

\subsection{Dataset structure}
The dataset contains:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item 67 features
    \item 363,243 instances
\end{itemize}
Given the large number of features, we will focus on a subset of relevant attributes for our analysis, including:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Age\_of\_Driver: ratio attribute
    \item Age\_of\_Casualty: ratio attribute
    \item 1st\_Point\_of\_Impact: nominal attribute
    \item Sex\_of\_Driver: nominal attribute
    \item Sex\_of\_Casualty: nominal attribute
    \item Weather\_Conditions: nominal attribute
    \item Road\_Surface\_Conditions: nominal attribute
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Target Attribute}
The target attribute for this dataset is the accident severity. This is a categorical variable with three possible values: fatal, serious, and slight.
TODO: add more details about the target attribute, such as its distribution and importance. ALSO check actual severity value labels once dataset is loaded.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
TODO describe preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features (including describing data ranges).

\section{Dataset 2: Website Phishing}
The Website Phishing dataset is a multi-class classification problem where we have to determine if a website is legitimate, suspicious, or phishing. It was chosen because it addresses a critical cybersecurity challenge in e-commerce and e-banking and provides diverse integer-encoded features representing various URL and website characteristics.
It will also require some preprocessing due to class imbalance. It is also a nice contrast to the first dataset since we are working with no numerical data and a small dataset compared to only numerical data and a large dataset.

\subsection{Dataset structure}
The dataset contains 1.353 instances with 10 features (9 input attributes + 1 target) and 3 classes (legitimate, suspicious, phishing). 
All attributes are integer-encoded categorical features with values ranging from -1 to 1: SFH (Server Form Handler), popUpWindow, SSLfinal\_State, Request\_URL, URL\_of\_Anchor, web\_traffic, URL\_Length, age\_of\_domain, having\_IP\_Address, and Result (target). 
Some features like age\_of\_domain, web\_traffic, and URL\_Length are ordinal with natural ordering, while others like having\_IP\_Address are nominal.

    \label{fig:phishing_overview}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:phishing_overview}, the dataset shows some class imbalance with the suspicious class representing only 7.6\% of cases, which will require some processing like class weights during training.
The risky feature analysis shows that SFH (Server Form Handler) and SSLfinal\_State are the strongest indicators for phishing sites showing 62\% and 43\% suspicious indicators respectively. Meanwhile the same features appear only around 10\% in legitimate sites. 
It is also important to note that no popUpWindow was found on phishing sites in this dataset.
